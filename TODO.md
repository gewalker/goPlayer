## TO DO LIST 

## Major refactor and rebrand (These are items I consider essential to rebranding the project)
* Create an interface to replace current calls to termui. Create a compatible wrapper for termui/v3 
* Add config file support to replace hardcoded paths and defaults (spf13/viper)
* Playlist manager and transport/playlist api for remote control
* Add tests. Not having them will be unsustainable as the project grows
* Add ogg, wav, aac support (EASY!)
* Rebranding, general code review and migration to new repo and project

## FEATURES (in no particular order--if you're forking this project, these will become issues soon)
* Add midi support (? is there any demand for this from anyone other than me and does that matter?)
* Visualizations: scope (use braille dots graph)
* Visualizations: spectrum analyzer (Can bar graph do a stacked chart in multiple colors?)
* Color themes for ui and vis

## Set up automated builds, releases
